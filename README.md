# Interactive Birthday Quest – The Memory Vault

A personalized birthday surprise website built as a gift for my best friend.
This project turns a simple birthday wish into an interactive adventure filled with fun, nostalgia, and celebration.

## Concept

Instead of a regular birthday card, this site creates a playful digital journey:

1. **Welcome Page** – A calm green and white themed landing screen invites the birthday girl into *The Memory Vault*.
2. **Memory Puzzle Game** – Inspired by *Hunter x Hunter*, she solves a custom memory card game.
3. **The Big Reveal** – After completing the puzzle, the screen transforms into a digital birthday party with confetti, balloons, and a warm atmosphere.
4. **Heartfelt AI Message** – At the center, a special AI-crafted poem, whimsical story, or wish appears — unique and personal just for her.
